# Medium Clone

This project is a clone of Medium built with a modern stack for both the frontend and backend. It includes features like JWT authentication, type-safe validation, and a robust backend with Cloudflare Workers, Prisma, and Postgres.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Typescript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.

### Backend
- **Cloudflare Workers**: A serverless compute platform for running backend code at the edge.
- **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM to interact with the database (Postgres in this case) with ease.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication.

### Common
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library for the frontend and backend.

### Database
- **Postgres**: A reliable, open-source relational database system.
